# Reflective Essay: Government Enquiries and AI Assistance in GCAP 3226


Participating in Part 4 of GCAP 3226 deepened my understanding of Hong Kongâ€™s Code on Access to Information and its importance for data transparency. Drafting a formal enquiry to the Environmental Protection Department required me to clearly articulate our research needs, specify the exact data requested, and reference the Code to support our case. This process highlighted the need for professionalism and precision in official communications.

AI assistance was invaluable in structuring my enquiry. The agent helped me organize my letter, use formal language, and ensure all required details were included. This support made the process less intimidating and improved the quality of my submission.

Receiving a positive response from the government would provide essential data for our analysis of the Green@Community program, directly benefiting our project. If the data is not provided, our contingency plan is to use available open data and supplement it with estimates or secondary sources, though this may limit the depth of our analysis.

Overall, this experience taught me the practical steps of requesting government data, the challenges of data access, and the value of AI tools in academic research. It reinforced the importance of persistence, adaptability, and critical reflection in participatory policy analysis.
